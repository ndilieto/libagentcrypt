NAME
----
agentcrypt - Symmetric encryption with SSH Agent


SYNOPSIS
--------
*agentcrypt* ['OPTION']... ['FILE']...


DESCRIPTION
-----------
*agentcrypt* allows using the keys in the SSH Agent to perform symmetric,
authenticated encryption and decryption securely without typing passwords.
It works with both RSA and ED25519 SSH keys including those made available
to a remote host by SSH Agent forwarding.

Whenever possible each file is replaced by one with the *.acb* or *.act*
extension (the latter when text mode is enabled) while keeping the same
ownership modes, access and modification times. Only regular files are
processed. In particular symbolic links are ignored. Encrypted files can
be restored to their original form using *agentcrypt -d*.


OPTIONS
-------
*-c*::
    By default *agentcrypt* encrypts or decrypts 'FILEs' in place.
    This option makes it write on *stdout* instead, leaving 'FILEs' unchanged.

*-d*::
    Enable decrypt mode (default is encrypt)

*-e* 'FINGERPRINT'::
    Encrypt using a ssh key with the specified SHA256 'FINGERPRINT', which may
    or may not include the "SHA256:" prefix. For ease of use 'FINGERPRINT'
    can also be shortened, as long as the beginning is specified.
    Use 'ssh-add -E sha256 -l' to display fingerprints of available keys
    (for this to work 'openssh' version 6.8 or later is required).
 
*-f*::
    Do not ask confirmation before overwriting an already existing file.
    Additionally enable outputting binary encrypted data to a terminal.

*-h*::
    Display a brief help

*-k*::
    Keep (don't delete) input files

*-t*::
    Text mode: encrypt or decrypt text line by line, output text

*-v*::
    Verbose mode. Display information about files being processed.

*-V*::
    Display version


USAGE
-----
*agentcrypt* 'filename'::
    Encrypt 'filename' and replace it wiht 'filename.acb'

*agentcrypt -k* 'filename':: 
    Same, but keep the original

*agentcrypt -e* 'FINGERPRINT' 'filename'::
    Same, but use the ssh key with the specified 'FINGERPRINT'
 
*agentcrypt -d* 'filename.acb'::
    Decrypt 'filename.acb' and replace it with 'filename'

*tar zc* 'data' | *agentcrypt* > 'data.tgz.acb'::
    Archive and encrypt 'data'

*agentcrypt -c -d* 'data.tgz.acb' | *tar zx*::
    Decrypt and extract 'data.tgz.acb'

*agentcrypt -t* 'filename'::
    Encrypt the 'filename' text file line by line and replace it with 
    'filename.act'

*agentcrypt -t -d* 'filename.act'::
    Decrypt 'filename.act' line by line and replace it with 'filename'

*agentcrypt -t*::
    Read lines of text from stdin, encrypt them one by one and output
    encrypted text to stdout. If stdin is a terminal, disable input echo.

*agentcrypt -t -d*::
    Read encrypted lines of text from term, decrypt them one by one and
    output decrypted text to stdout.


ENVIRONMENT
-----------

*agentcrypt* takes the path to the SSH Agent UNIX-domain socket from the
'SSH_AUTH_SOCK' environment variable.


EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
    Success

*1*::
    Failure (syntax or usage error; configuration error; 
    processing failure; unexpected error).
